now ive been a huge sketchers go walk fan for some time and the only reason i tried these instead of the latest number 4 of those is because the tread looked too slippery to me.
these shoes are very sturdy and the grip of the soles has been very solid so far. i use them for basic workout cardio and cross training, as well as work as a massage therapist (i go through shoes fast enough that ive recently consolidated).
if you're a go walk fan, these do not offer the same level of cushion-comfort as those, however, they offer the kind of long-term comfort to make them a durable option.
the material of the shoes seem very durable and the breathable. my feet do not feel hot in them.

they look good with just about anything, and are comfortable for most situations.
with the exception of running (for which i use proper mizuno running sneakers with an arch-support insole), these sneakers are my go-to.
if i could, i'd take away a 1/2 star for arch support - i have a slightly wider front of the foot and arches that are a little on the high side, so i do look for a good under the foot fit. i could probably tie the laces differently or put in an insole(they're pretty expensive), but as is, when i did a zumba class in these, my arch began to twinge :(
however, this is overall an awesome shoe that i will continue to stick with for going out, day to day walking, and for training and gym use (with the exception of running and zumba (although hip-hop was fine). the shoes have a great flexibility to them and don't look ""dirty"" easily. my previous pair of flex supreme tr 3s have lasted for a good 2 years and are just now on the verge of being worn out. this is the optimal sneaker that is flexible in more ways than one: from pointing you toes to leg-pressing, from gym use to shopping to adding a sporty edge to a dressy night out, the flex has it all.",simply supreme.,1471651200,,,0

now ive been a huge sketchers go walk fan for some time and the only reason i tried these instead of the latest number 4 of those is because the tread looked too slippery to me.
these shoes are very sturdy and the grip of the soles has been very solid so far. i use them for basic workout cardio and cross training, as well as work as a massage therapist (i go through shoes fast enough that ive recently consolidated).
if you're a go walk fan, these do not offer the same level of cushion-comfort as those, however, they offer the kind of long-term comfort to make them a durable option.
the material of the shoes seem very durable and the breathable. my feet do not feel hot in them.
now these shoes are ideal for a basic workout or cross training, i would not get them to do 25,000 steps in walt disney world.

they look good with just about anything, and are comfortable for most situations.
with the exception of running (for which i use proper mizuno running sneakers with an arch-support insole), these sneakers are my go-to.
if i could, i'd take away a 1/2 star for arch support - i have a slightly wider front of the foot and arches that are a little on the high side, so i do look for a good under the foot fit. i could probably tie the laces differently or put in an insole(they're pretty expensive), but as is, when i did a zumba class in these, my arch began to twinge :(
however, this is overall an awesome shoe that i will continue to stick with for going out, day to day walking, and for training and gym use (with the exception of running and zumba (although hip-hop was fine). the shoes have a great flexibility to them and don't look ""dirty"" easily. my previous pair of flex supreme tr 3s have lasted for a good 2 years and are just now on the verge of being worn out. this is the optimal sneaker that is flexible in more ways than one: from pointing you toes to leg-pressing, from gym use to shopping to adding a sporty edge to a dressy night out, the flex has it all.",simply supreme.,1471651200,,,0

now ive been a huge sketchers go walk fan for some time and the only reason i tried these instead of the latest number 4 of those is because the tread looked too slippery to me.
these shoes are very sturdy and the grip of the soles has been very solid so far. i use them for basic workout cardio and cross training, as well as work as a massage therapist (i go through shoes fast enough that ive recently consolidated).
if you're a go walk fan, these do not offer the same level of cushion-comfort as those, however, they offer the kind of long-term comfort to make them a durable option.
the material of the shoes seem very durable and the breathable. my feet do not feel hot in them.

they look good with just about anything, and are comfortable for most situations.
with the exception of running (for which i use proper mizuno running sneakers with an arch-support insole), these sneakers are my go-to.
if i could, i'd take away a 1/2 star for arch support - i have a slightly wider front of the foot and arches that are a little on the high side, so i do look for a good under the foot fit. i could probably tie the laces differently or put in an insole(they're pretty expensive), but as is, when i did a zumba class in these, my arch began to twinge :(
however, this is overall an awesome shoe that i will continue to stick with for going out, day to day walking, and for training and gym use (with the exception of running and zumba (although hip-hop was fine). the shoes have a great flexibility to them and don't look ""dirty"" easily. my previous pair of flex supreme tr 3s have lasted for a good 2 years and are just now on the verge of being worn out. this is the optimal sneaker that is flexible in more ways than one: from pointing you toes to leg-pressing, from gym use to shopping to adding a sporty edge to a dressy night out, the flex has it all.",simply supreme.,1471651200,,,0

now ive been a huge sketchers go walk fan for some time and the only reason i tried these instead of the latest number 4 of those is because the tread looked too slippery to me.
these shoes are very sturdy and the grip of the soles has been very solid so far. i use them for basic workout cardio and cross training, as well as work as a massage therapist (i go through shoes fast enough that ive recently consolidated).
if you're a go walk fan, these do not offer the same level of cushion-comfort as those, however, they offer the kind of long-term comfort to make them a durable option.
the material of the shoes seem very durable and the breathable. my feet do not feel hot in them.

they look good with just about anything, and are comfortable for most situations.
with the exception of running (for which i use proper mizuno running sneakers with an arch-support insole), these sneakers are my go-to.
if i could, i'd take away a 1/2 star for arch support - i have a slightly wider front of the foot and arches that are a little on the high side, so i do look for a good under the foot fit. i could probably tie the laces differently or put in an insole(they're pretty expensive), but as is, when i did a zumba class in these, my arch began to twinge :(
however, this is overall an awesome shoe that i will continue to stick with for going out, day to day walking, and for training and gym use (with the exception of running and zumba (although hip-hop was fine). the shoes have a great flexibility to them and don't look ""dirty"" easily. my previous pair of flex supreme tr 3s have lasted for a good 2 years and are just now on the verge of being worn out. this is the optimal sneaker that is flexible in more ways than one: from pointing you toes to leg-pressing, from gym use to shopping to adding a sporty edge to a dressy night out, the flex has it all.",simply supreme.,1471651200,,,0

now ive been a huge sketchers go walk fan for some time and the only reason i tried these instead of the latest number 4 of those is because the tread looked too slippery to me.
these shoes are very sturdy and the grip of the soles has been very solid so far. i use them for basic workout cardio and cross training, as well as work as a massage therapist (i go through shoes fast enough that ive recently consolidated).
if you're a go walk fan, these do not offer the same level of cushion-comfort as those, however, they offer the kind of long-term comfort to make them a durable option.
the material of the shoes seem very durable and the breathable. my feet do not feel hot in them.
now these shoes are ideal for a basic workout or cross training, i would not get them to do 25,000 steps in walt disney world.

i have worn them hiking in a pinch but don't really recommend it because the material is mesh-like and will let a lot of dirt in. but if you mainly take cardio classes and/or do weight training or just need something to wear around town look no further.","very comfortable, cute, and long-lasting",1515369600,,,0

they look good with just about anything, and are comfortable for most situations.
with the exception of running (for which i use proper mizuno running sneakers with an arch-support insole), these sneakers are my go-to.
if i could, i'd take away a 1/2 star for arch support - i have a slightly wider front of the foot and arches that are a little on the high side, so i do look for a good under the foot fit. i could probably tie the laces differently or put in an insole(they're pretty expensive), but as is, when i did a zumba class in these, my arch began to twinge :(

now ive been a huge sketchers go walk fan for some time and the only reason i tried these instead of the latest number 4 of those is because the tread looked too slippery to me.
these shoes are very sturdy and the grip of the soles has been very solid so far. i use them for basic workout cardio and cross training, as well as work as a massage therapist (i go through shoes fast enough that ive recently consolidated).
if you're a go walk fan, these do not offer the same level of cushion-comfort as those, however, they offer the kind of long-term comfort to make them a durable option.
the material of the shoes seem very durable and the breathable. my feet do not feel hot in them.

they look good with just about anything, and are comfortable for most situations.
with the exception of running (for which i use proper mizuno running sneakers with an arch-support insole), these sneakers are my go-to.
if i could, i'd take away a 1/2 star for arch support - i have a slightly wider front of the foot and arches that are a little on the high side, so i do look for a good under the foot fit. i could probably tie the laces differently or put in an insole(they're pretty expensive), but as is, when i did a zumba class in these, my arch began to twinge :(
however, this is overall an awesome shoe that i will continue to stick with for going out, day to day walking, and for training and gym use (with the exception of running and zumba (although hip-hop was fine). the shoes have a great flexibility to them and don't look ""dirty"" easily. my previous pair of flex supreme tr 3s have lasted for a good 2 years and are just now on the verge of being worn out. this is the optimal sneaker that is flexible in more ways than one: from pointing you toes to leg-pressing, from gym use to shopping to adding a sporty edge to a dressy night out, the flex has it all.",simply supreme.,1471651200,,,0

now ive been a huge sketchers go walk fan for some time and the only reason i tried these instead of the latest number 4 of those is because the tread looked too slippery to me.
these shoes are very sturdy and the grip of the soles has been very solid so far. i use them for basic workout cardio and cross training, as well as work as a massage therapist (i go through shoes fast enough that ive recently consolidated).
if you're a go walk fan, these do not offer the same level of cushion-comfort as those, however, they offer the kind of long-term comfort to make them a durable option.
the material of the shoes seem very durable and the breathable. my feet do not feel hot in them.

the pink is even pinker than shown and the light gray is over the very bright pink so it isn't as gray as shown in the picture. it makes the shoe a bit overwhelming. also two grommets on each shoe is dark. i'm not referring to the dark grommets closer to the toe as shown in the photo, i'm talking about two grommets up at the top of of the laces (opposite side of side shown in photo). i thought it was faulty at first until i noticed they were on the same side of each shoe. kind of odd and not pictured.

overall, they are very comfortable shoes which is why i am keeping them...even if you can see me coming from a mile away.",i usually wear a 9 but could have easily ordered a 8,1512432000,,,1

they look good with just about anything, and are comfortable for most situations.
with the exception of running (for which i use proper mizuno running sneakers with an arch-support insole), these sneakers are my go-to.
if i could, i'd take away a 1/2 star for arch support - i have a slightly wider front of the foot and arches that are a little on the high side, so i do look for a good under the foot fit. i could probably tie the laces differently or put in an insole(they're pretty expensive), but as is, when i did a zumba class in these, my arch began to twinge :(
however, this is overall an awesome shoe that i will continue to stick with for going out, day to day walking, and for training and gym use (with the exception of running and zumba (although hip-hop was fine). the shoes have a great flexibility to them and don't look ""dirty"" easily. my previous pair of flex supreme tr 3s have lasted for a good 2 years and are just now on the verge of being worn out. this is the optimal sneaker that is flexible in more ways than one: from pointing you toes to leg-pressing, from gym use to shopping to adding a sporty edge to a dressy night out, the flex has it all.",simply supreme.,1471651200,,,0

now ive been a huge sketchers go walk fan for some time and the only reason i tried these instead of the latest number 4 of those is because the tread looked too slippery to me.
these shoes are very sturdy and the grip of the soles has been very solid so far. i use them for basic workout cardio and cross training, as well as work as a massage therapist (i go through shoes fast enough that ive recently consolidated).
if you're a go walk fan, these do not offer the same level of cushion-comfort as those, however, they offer the kind of long-term comfort to make them a durable option.
the material of the shoes seem very durable and the breathable. my feet do not feel hot in them.

they look good with just about anything, and are comfortable for most situations.
with the exception of running (for which i use proper mizuno running sneakers with an arch-support insole), these sneakers are my go-to.
if i could, i'd take away a 1/2 star for arch support - i have a slightly wider front of the foot and arches that are a little on the high side, so i do look for a good under the foot fit. i could probably tie the laces differently or put in an insole(they're pretty expensive), but as is, when i did a zumba class in these, my arch began to twinge :(
however, this is overall an awesome shoe that i will continue to stick with for going out, day to day walking, and for training and gym use (with the exception of running and zumba (although hip-hop was fine). the shoes have a great flexibility to them and don't look ""dirty"" easily. my previous pair of flex supreme tr 3s have lasted for a good 2 years and are just now on the verge of being worn out. this is the optimal sneaker that is flexible in more ways than one: from pointing you toes to leg-pressing, from gym use to shopping to adding a sporty edge to a dressy night out, the flex has it all.",simply supreme.,1471651200,,,0

there slogan was "" there is nothing like an aqua velva man "" and it seemed to work because this was a hot item when i was a young man. it's just amazing that this is still around when the vast majority of after shave lotions from that time period have disappeared over the years.

the only negative about aqua velva is it does not last very long. usually in less than an hour the aroma has dissipated. the more expensive after shave lotions and perfumes have ambergris in them which is quite expensive and comes from a sperm whale this enables the aroma to linger much longer.

at any rate this is a great classic after shave with a wonderful refreshing odor, give it a try you might just like it.

the bristles are unbelievably soft and give a really even powder coverage and its very easy to vary the fullness of coverage with this brush. the angle is absolutely perfect for applying foundation. i find that this brush works really well with the bare minerals loose powder foundation, though i've gotten wonderful results using this brush with pressed powder as well.

 this shade is sultry and sun kissed with this hollywood photoshop filler thing going on, it simply looks delicious. i love the whole range and im also a fan of the nars sin  and orgasm blushes, but this is the best.

monoi tiare tahiti coconut oil vanilla -- 4 fl oz
sold by: express health
$11.26

it is made in tahiti and has a real vanilla bean in the bottom of the bottle.  because it has coconut oil in it, it solidifies at 68 degrees, but all you have to do is put it into your hand and it melts.  it smells so good!  it also has tiare flower scent in it that the bath & body works formula had as well as vitamin e and actual vanilla bean fragrance from a real vanilla bean.  it is only 4 ounces, but a little goes a long way and is only $11.26.  this is a body lotion and it smells awesome and is the closest thing to the b&bw formula i could find with a reasonable price tag.

on opening the bottle, the fragrance was not overpowering or chemical-smelling, at all;  in fact, it was quite the opposite,  it has a great aroma with, not really a subtle scent, rather more subdued, and certainly not overwhelming.  in addition to nutmeg, i have also tried citrus, eucalyptus, cucumber, sage and black pepper, and all of them have been outstanding fragrances.  i was also impressed by the small amount of gel needed to clean the entire body.  many of the other brands that i have tried seem to over-foam and usually leave a little residue that needs a secondary rinse to remove.  this is not the case with any of the pattern products i have tried.  the body wash is silky, with just the right amount of lather, and it cleans exceptionally well.

one of the other areas, in which i compare body washes, is the dryness that ensues after toweling off after a shower.  pattern is exceptional in this realm and leaves the skin smooth and soft, even in a very dry climate with little humidity.

the price point is certainly several dollars more than i would normally spend on a standard body wash, but in all truth, one bottle lasts longer than all of the other companies i have tried over the past 20 years.

this wash beats soap anytime in the shower; the orange gelee collapses on itself when poured and feels cool and refreshing especially in the morning. i love the scent, its very delicate, smell like soft fruit scented air, nothing aggressive and doesn't feel too organic and strange but fancy enough. there is ginko biloba and cucumber water, green tea, chamomile, orange and of course carrots, silky aloe, cleansing dead sea water and even spirulina extract, which i have drank before but never used in products. it feels very light and my skin always feels clean but light, never dry and uncomfortable. the bottle is also large and lasts a while, which is nice.

as i get older it becomes more important to me to use as little chemicals as possible, of course in today&iexcl;s world we are bombarded with them and its hard since they appear in everything but still, ever little thing counts. parabens for example are used as preservatives and are generally considered safe because of low levels of toxicity, but lately i keep reading how traces are found in cancer lumps especially in women and simply knowing that a cosmetic doesn't have it makes me happy. and i love my cosmetics almost as much as books, the bathroom is always stacked : )

this wash smells like the salty ocean water, sunscreen lotion, sun, sand and a slight layer of milky fruit. it's really radiant and silky on and has the most incredible fresh scent; it makes me feel as if i have entered a paradise island and im watching the sunset settling in misty colored sweet clouds as waves crash at my feet as i have never used a product that smelled this unique. at first this will smell faint, but using this with scrubby gloves or those bath poofs will yield luxe foam and a burst of some peaceful mineral rich island.",invigorating dip in the ocean,1148083200,,,0

monoi tiare tahiti coconut oil vanilla -- 4 fl oz
sold by: express health
$11.26

it is made in tahiti and has a real vanilla bean in the bottom of the bottle.  because it has coconut oil in it, it solidifies at 68 degrees, but all you have to do is put it into your hand and it melts.  it smells so good!  it also has tiare flower scent in it that the bath & body works formula had as well as vitamin e and actual vanilla bean fragrance from a real vanilla bean.  it is only 4 ounces, but a little goes a long way and is only $11.26.  this is a body lotion and it smells awesome and is the closest thing to the b&bw formula i could find with a reasonable price tag.

5,True,"09 19, 2013",A3N81O636W6H9A,B000FI4S1E,,Ben Freeman,"having given up on bar soap and its innate ability to dry my skin out, i have been using shower gel for years.  until recently, i've had no preference to any brand, as i felt they were all pretty similar.  after seeing some of the awards that pattern body wash has received in various men's magazines i decided to try it for myself.

on opening the bottle, the fragrance was not overpowering or chemical-smelling, at all;  in fact, it was quite the opposite,  it has a great aroma with, not really a subtle scent, rather more subdued, and certainly not overwhelming.  in addition to nutmeg, i have also tried citrus, eucalyptus, cucumber, sage and black pepper, and all of them have been outstanding fragrances.  i was also impressed by the small amount of gel needed to clean the entire body.  many of the other brands that i have tried seem to over-foam and usually leave a little residue that needs a secondary rinse to remove.  this is not the case with any of the pattern products i have tried.  the body wash is silky, with just the right amount of lather, and it cleans exceptionally well.

one of the other areas, in which i compare body washes, is the dryness that ensues after toweling off after a shower.  pattern is exceptional in this realm and leaves the skin smooth and soft, even in a very dry climate with little humidity.

the price point is certainly several dollars more than i would normally spend on a standard body wash, but in all truth, one bottle lasts longer than all of the other companies i have tried over the past 20 years.

great job pattern on a fantastic product, you have made a routine shower a much better experience.",outstanding body wash,1379548800,,,0

there slogan was "" there is nothing like an aqua velva man "" and it seemed to work because this was a hot item when i was a young man. it's just amazing that this is still around when the vast majority of after shave lotions from that time period have disappeared over the years.

the only negative about aqua velva is it does not last very long. usually in less than an hour the aroma has dissipated. the more expensive after shave lotions and perfumes have ambergris in them which is quite expensive and comes from a sperm whale this enables the aroma to linger much longer.

at any rate this is a great classic after shave with a wonderful refreshing odor, give it a try you might just like it.

this model has a varying speed control to increase the water pressure to whatever is comfortable and effective for the individual user. it also comes with six different tips. while i use the flossing tip, there are tips for brace wearers, people who have crowns,etc, a tongue cleaner, and a couple of other tips for specific functions.

after looking at all the models, we choose this one. it holds a lot of water. it has storage in the lid for all the attachments, and it seemed easy to use.

i looked at the ones that were battery powered but i didn't think they would hold enough water and i couldn't see him refilling it to finish. this model has a big range of pressure that changes quickly with the turn of a dial. it does have to be plugged in and the handle is connected by a water tube. this does limit the distance from the unit to the mouth but it is more than enough if you are standing at a vanity.

there is a huge variety of tips but i don't think we will be using more than two or three. i actually wish that there were two or three of the basic tips for multiple family members instead of some of the other fancy tips.

the tips pop on and off easily and there is a 'pause' button on the handle that allow you to shut the water spray off quickly. this way, you can turn it on, position it in your mouth and then start the water spray.

it is easy to use. you just fill the basin with water, pick your setting with the dial, and turn it on. it is a little messy - water run off - but it is worth it! i use it on the highest setting with no discomfort or pain at all. the different heads are all very useful and store right in the lid of the basin. it flips open and there is a compartmnt to keep them all. the coiled cord stays neatly in place in the holster when not in use.

i went home and started using the sonicare i had bought but never plugged in. that was good, but not enough - i bought a waterpik because obviously flossing wasn't cutting it.

i had never used a waterpik before, and it was some revelation! i'm still amazed that there are some waterpik oldtimers who say this machine isn't strong enough...uh, for what? peeling paint off a brick wall? this thing absolutely knocked my socks off when it came to the pressure.

i started out at 2 and worked my way up to 7 - it still stings like mad, but i'm getting used to it by now. i put listerine in the tank to increase the anti-bacteria result.

my dentist went on vacation, and i had to cancel another appointment, so it happened that almost two months had elapsed since the last time i had seen him. in that time, i faithfully brushed with the sonicare four times a day and used the waterpik at least once (several tankfuls of water and listerine worth.)

regarding the leaking people talk about - the only time the tank leaks, i notice, is if i put my fingers on the seal when i'm refilling it. if i'm careful to keep my fingers away from that seal, the tank is water tight.

so when i returned for my check-up, the dentist was amazed. he wasn't sure what i had done, but he said my gums looked pink and healthy! he had said initially i'd have to get my teeth cleaned every three months because i must be one of those people who gets a tartar build up quicker than other people...well, i had worked religiously on scaling back the plaque. (i had also bought a dental mirror so i could check the back of my front teeth for telltale plaque residue.)

hmmm, no comment about that plaque...was it because there wasn't any? my dentist asked me if i had been eating because there was so little build up (i had to tear that out of him because i knew he didn't want to give me credit for working that hard on my dental hygiene!)

now that my son has some orthodontia, the dentist suggested using a waterpik.

this thing is unbelievable. the spray comes out so fast and the spray is so wide, that it makes a huge mess. even i, a coordinated adult, have a hard time using this without spraying down the bathroom walls, mirror, and countertop. this is a mess. i am worried the wallpaper will be ruined and will begin peeling off.

tip: put the device in the mouth, then turn it on. try to use it with your mouth closed or nearly closed and shut it off before you remove it from your mouth.

after reading other customer reviews, to prevent possible leakage, we take the unit apart and dump out the water after each usage.

to get the most out of the unit you have to read the manual. it clearly states that you should not leave water in the reservoir (why you would want to anyway is beyond me - why would anyone want to use stale water?). if you don't leave water in it, it won't leak out on your counter. pretty simple equation there.

i agree with several others that the tongue cleaning attachments are basically useless. they don't fit into the holder anyway, so just toss them out. sure, try it, but i'll bet you'll find it to be basically useless compared with a true tongue cleaner (i.e., a scraper type device).

the water reservoir could be a bit bigger - an additional 20% bigger would be nice. but, it's very easy to fill even when the unit is running (keep a glass of water handy and just pour it in when the water level is at the half-way point). simple and easy, and the smaller reservoir does have the benefit of keeping the unit size nice and compact.

sound level is very low compared with past waterpik units. no, it's not silent, but it is no more noise than you would get with any other electric appliance in the bathroom such as an electric toothbrush or a shaver.  in fact, it is less noise than my shaver.

the auto-retractable hose is a very nice touch and keeps everything neat. again, a couple inches longer would be nice, but there's the compact size trade-off again.

in actual performance - wow!  you will never believe that your teeth could get this clean! wonderful feeling. there is a wide range of power adjustments ranging from very gentle to ouch! i've found setting the dial to the 5/6 range gives a good cleaning without any discomfort.

but how a rinse tastes is important since you'll be tasting it for some time after use. this was overly sweet rather than ""fresh mint"" tasting like other rinses (such as act). the aftertaste remained sweet to the point where it was unpleasant.

i'm was concerned about the potential for tooth staining. i've not had any issues with that so far with this rinse, but it was a concern.

amazingly, this actually tastes very good, whereas every non-alcoholic mouthwash i've ever had before (mostly in hotels) has been horrible.  the ironic thing is that it says they don't use alcohol so that you don't get that burn.  despite the fact that the burn is what makes me feel like it's doing its job, there is more burn in this than the version with the alcohol!  admittedly, that burn is slightly different.

one thing i do appreciate is that crest did not use yellow #5 food coloring to make this mouthwash, since most companies use that color to produce the green hue in their products (including scope). some people, myself included, have a sever food allergy to yellow #5 and can't use or eat anything with that food coloring it it. for those with this condition, note that crest has used yellow #6 instead to create the mouthwashes green color. the crest pro-heath mouth wash in the invigorating clean version, which is an even greener colored mouthwash, also doesn't use yellow #5, and used #6. so anyone with this food coloring sensitivity who wants to try these out, can do so knowing these won't have yellow #5 in them.",wintergreen version for those who prefer it over mint,1365638400,,,0

the rinse comes in an easy to used bottle with a pleasing contour. i did not particuarly care for the wintergreen flavor, it was rather sweet, mint-like and artificial. but my major concern come from the potential side effects for the active ingredient, cetylpridinium chloride. while it has antiseptic, anesthetic and disinfectant properties it is used in bug poisons as well as dental preparations. while its use has been fda approved, i think there are more natural, less toxic and equally effective ingredients available. moreover this ingredient has been known to cause browning of the teeth as well as intefering with the sense of taste. the bottle label warns of the discoloration risk but claims that the staining is neither permanent nor harmful. it claims such stains may be removed by brushing or ""at your next dental visit"". if my teeth suddenly browned, i don't think i would want to wait for my next regularly scheduled dental visit. dental visits don't rate high on my fun things to do list and i would rather not spend my discretionary income on removing tooth discoloration caused by a mouth wash.

there are plenty of pros about this razor.  the trimmer does a decent job evening out the sideburns.  the razor tells you how much time the battery has left so you should never run out of juice in the middle of shave and it is easy to charge either on the stand or in the carring case the razor comes with.  the razor is really easy to clean.  and there is little to no irritation after the shave aside from a couple minutes of numbness right after the shave, but it's nothing a splash of water won't cure.

i think i finally found the answer after i started using the new philips norelco drive-shave system. first, let me sing a praise for its smooth design and ingenious way of reminding me when i need to clean the blades (a cool blue image of a water faucet appears on the handle immediately after each shave) and how many minutes of battery life remain (cool blue large numbers appear after every shave as a reminder). as far as i am concerned these are the two main things i need to know so that i can get the job done.  next, let share with you how wonderful i feel after each shave. the benefits of dry shaving prevented my skin from being exposed to the sharp blades and water, which in my opinion are solely responsible for the irritation of my skin.

if i could recommend one minor improvement, it would be to make the system's blades sensitive enough to be able to remove even the smallest or toughest hairs on my neck. i find myself having to reapply some circulating effort around the same areas every time until i get all the hairs out of the way. still, this is a small price to pay considering the fact that i am pain and embracement free after each shave. a great gift idea.",end of all irritation,1197331200,,,0

monoi tiare tahiti coconut oil vanilla -- 4 fl oz
sold by: express health
$11.26

it is made in tahiti and has a real vanilla bean in the bottom of the bottle.  because it has coconut oil in it, it solidifies at 68 degrees, but all you have to do is put it into your hand and it melts.  it smells so good!  it also has tiare flower scent in it that the bath & body works formula had as well as vitamin e and actual vanilla bean fragrance from a real vanilla bean.  it is only 4 ounces, but a little goes a long way and is only $11.26.  this is a body lotion and it smells awesome and is the closest thing to the b&bw formula i could find with a reasonable price tag.

on opening the bottle, the fragrance was not overpowering or chemical-smelling, at all;  in fact, it was quite the opposite,  it has a great aroma with, not really a subtle scent, rather more subdued, and certainly not overwhelming.  in addition to nutmeg, i have also tried citrus, eucalyptus, cucumber, sage and black pepper, and all of them have been outstanding fragrances.  i was also impressed by the small amount of gel needed to clean the entire body.  many of the other brands that i have tried seem to over-foam and usually leave a little residue that needs a secondary rinse to remove.  this is not the case with any of the pattern products i have tried.  the body wash is silky, with just the right amount of lather, and it cleans exceptionally well.

one of the other areas, in which i compare body washes, is the dryness that ensues after toweling off after a shower.  pattern is exceptional in this realm and leaves the skin smooth and soft, even in a very dry climate with little humidity.

the price point is certainly several dollars more than i would normally spend on a standard body wash, but in all truth, one bottle lasts longer than all of the other companies i have tried over the past 20 years.

this one, thankfully, leaves my skin nothing but silky smooth and smelling wonderful! i have learned the hard way that things that are orchid scented either turn out fresh and delightful, or horribly wrong. this is definitely fresh and delightful. if you are a fan of olay's orchid body wash, or a fan of orchid in general, definitely give this a try.",so cozy!!,1370476800,,,0

i have a sonicare toothbrush so for me the head of the toothbrush fit inside without a problem.  if you have another model then there are adapters you can put on it so that you can clean any other toothbrush.  but since i don't use them, i can't comment on how well they work.

the cleaning itself is pretty easy.  just put it in, make sure the brushes are pointed the right way, close the lid, and hit the power button.  ten minutes later it is done and all those big, bad bacteria are dead... well, 99% of them anyways.

so, there you have it, it works and it is easy to make it work.  what more could you ask for?

as a note, i do want to comment on what another reviewer wrote.  namely, that people have survived decades without a device like this.  and i'd have to agree.  that is why i mentioned in the title that this may be perfect for hypochondriacs while most people will shrug and wonder what the point is.  for me, it is more of an ocd where i like to be thorough on the things i do.  therefore, when i give my brush a thorough cleaning (monthly or so) then i like to finish it off inside of this product.  it's all a mental game and if this product makes you feel better/safer then it is worth every penny.",for the hypochondriac in you,1198627200,,,0

well, no more. i have an automatic toothbrush and all i do now is put its head in this neat sanitizer and it kills all the bacteria and i can go on for another 20-30 days without having to worry about repeating this process. the product has uv bulb, which is what actually kills the bacteria. there is an extra brush head holder for different models of brush heads (oral-b-flexisoft and flossaction and most sonicare models). i didn't have troubles putting the holder into the sanitizer. the cleaning takes approximately 10 minutes and when complete it shuts itself off. it was prebuilt with a drip tray to get rid of excess water. this is a great gift for anyone in your family. folks, it doesn't get any easier or more practical than this.","folks, it doesn't get any easier than this",1197936000,,,0

the recharging stand has worked well enough for me in the past, and i've never had any issue with bacteria on my brush heads.  rinse thoroughly after use and tap to get the water out, that should be enough in my opinion.  as the ""biologist"" stated in his review, this seems a bit like overkill.

because this isn't a foaming product, you do have to use more than you would with some competing products.  i found it non-irritating, too.  (you can see the full ingredients list if you scroll down the main product page.)

this does have a strong smell.  i kind of like it, but i have heard from plenty of people who detest the scent.  it's an artificial blueberry sort of scent.  so if you have reactions to strong fragrances, you may want to stay away.","you'll either love or hate the scent (and it's strong); otherwise, a decent product",1429833600,,,0

when distributed from the container, it has an airy texture. however, it doesn't foam terribly well, so when you spread it out over the area to be shaved (i used it on my lower legs), it can be hard to see. (i could feel it, though, if i ran my finger over my legs.)

i do think this helped in terms of providing a close, fairly smooth shave. my legs were soft afterwards, though i did also use a body lotion.

monoi tiare tahiti coconut oil vanilla -- 4 fl oz
sold by: express health
$11.26

it is made in tahiti and has a real vanilla bean in the bottom of the bottle.  because it has coconut oil in it, it solidifies at 68 degrees, but all you have to do is put it into your hand and it melts.  it smells so good!  it also has tiare flower scent in it that the bath & body works formula had as well as vitamin e and actual vanilla bean fragrance from a real vanilla bean.  it is only 4 ounces, but a little goes a long way and is only $11.26.  this is a body lotion and it smells awesome and is the closest thing to the b&bw formula i could find with a reasonable price tag.

on opening the bottle, the fragrance was not overpowering or chemical-smelling, at all;  in fact, it was quite the opposite,  it has a great aroma with, not really a subtle scent, rather more subdued, and certainly not overwhelming.  in addition to nutmeg, i have also tried citrus, eucalyptus, cucumber, sage and black pepper, and all of them have been outstanding fragrances.  i was also impressed by the small amount of gel needed to clean the entire body.  many of the other brands that i have tried seem to over-foam and usually leave a little residue that needs a secondary rinse to remove.  this is not the case with any of the pattern products i have tried.  the body wash is silky, with just the right amount of lather, and it cleans exceptionally well.

one of the other areas, in which i compare body washes, is the dryness that ensues after toweling off after a shower.  pattern is exceptional in this realm and leaves the skin smooth and soft, even in a very dry climate with little humidity.

the price point is certainly several dollars more than i would normally spend on a standard body wash, but in all truth, one bottle lasts longer than all of the other companies i have tried over the past 20 years.

great job pattern on a fantastic product, you have made a routine shower a much better experience.",outstanding body wash,1379548800,,,0

- repels water
- appears to be well made

even though this is a wet or dry shave razor it seemed to drag a bit when dry shaving. maybe because of some slight perspiration i don't know, but it did not move smoothly over my skin. than i thought of williams lectric shave, something i have heard of for years but never tried.

the first thing i did when i got it home was smell it and was not impressed with the odor, in fact i thought it was extremely unpleasent. i figured i'll use it to shave, than wash it off and that will be the end of it. but noooo i shaved than washed it off 1 time, 2 times than a third time and the smell did not disappear from my face or hands. plus the odor lingered for hours. i don't know if it is just me but i think the smell is just awful and i would not buy it again just for that reason. i would check out the other brands on the market.

as for the actual purpose of this lotion, i was impressed it worked exceptionally well. the razor glided over my face without any kind of drag and evidently did what it was supposed to since i got an exceptionally close comfortable shave.

so 5 stars for the shave and 1 star for the odor. i have plenty of after shave lotions that i really like and resent the fact that i am forced to use there odor if i want a good shave. odorless for this product would be a definite plus. my 2 cats won't eat any treats i give them if i have this odor on my hands, at least i have 2 paw's up on my assessment of the odor. ha!",yes it works quite well ~ but unpleasent odor ~,1302480000,12,,1

the backstory
our boy is 14 and is having to begin shaving several times a week. (somehow it doesn't seem right that our baby is shaving. sigh.)  this shaving is aggravating his breakouts taking them up a level.  we got this clean & clear cleanser to see what results we could get with an over the counter product.  after a week and a half there wasn't (initially) enough improvement so we made an appointment with a dermatologist.

we've since cancelled that appointment because i happened to watch boy wash his face one night. no wash cloth.  i smacked my forehead and took the time to show him how to properly wash his face.  apparently this is a thing guys don't all know.  it's been a week since the demonstration (which included a mention that you don't scrub your face fiercely. that the skin there is delicate, particularly under the eyes....)  and his face is looking really good.  i suspect in another few days even the small spots will be gone.

summing it  up
this is working for us.  if you've got  younger teen using it, i highly recommend making sure that they know what they should be doing.  don't assume they read the directions, even if they read everything else that crosses their path.

(i am reminded of this every now and then when i run out of glide and have to use free floss samples from the dentist until i can run to the store to restock.)

i started using glide floss when i got braces (had them from age 25-28!).  i got tired of shredding floss on all the little wires, brackets, etc., and then trying to have to get it unstuck.  glide wasn't 100% shred proof, but it outperformed any other floss i tried, and i would definitely recommend it to anyone with dental work to maneuver around (i had a wire glued to the back of my bottom teeth after my braces were removed, so i am stuck with a minor amount of dental work for life).

unlike some of the other reviewers, i didn't even notice the change from original glide (goretex) to the current product.  well, i noticed the package was different, i suppose, but i felt like the product was still quite good.  i find it to be quite strong and not easily breakable (have even used it to sew up holes in dog toys).",favorite floss,1371081600,,,0

this is a generous amount of dried (loose) lavender blossoms designed to act in the same fashion as potpourri. the most important aspect to this product is the scent which i found to be delicate and natural. lavender in general can be fairly overbearing, and you can smell this through the packet as it is relatively potent. however, it is not cloying or suffocating in its potency. i'm guessing this is because it's not as concentrated as a perfume or extract.

when you have the bag open and are exposed to all of it at once, it seems really strong, but as something you place in a location in lesser quantities, it doesn't tend to be so overbearing. i think that it strikes a good balance between being potent enough to have an effect and not being so potent as to make you queasy from a strong scent. i have had a lavender-scented face mask (the sort filled with beans that you heat or cool and apply to your face) for some time and found that putting that mask in a plastic zipper bag with a sachet made from these dried blossoms helped revived the fading scent quite well without have to risk staining the mask or making it smell too strong from using oils or perfume.

if there is any weak point to this, it is the presentation which can be a bit messy. i had to be very careful when opening the package not to spill the small, dried bits. it would have been better if it had come in a resealable package or a jar of some sort given how tiny they are. i decanted mine into a jar both to keep the scent contained in the long run and to more easily manage them. still, since this point is intrinsic to the type of product this is (tiny dried blossoms), i'm not dinging it for that, but just noting it.",good natural scent,1505520000,,,0

first of all there are slight curves on the handle. this means that whether you grip the brush at the top or closer to the bottom it will be comfortable and not slip around. the bristles look to be natural, and have just the right amount of stiffness for exfoliation. simply rub on your skin gently so that all of the dead skin flakes off.

however, let's talk about what this brush is great for: exfoliating! one can do a light dry rub before a shower or a lighter rub during the shower (be careful, wet skin is more delicate). this will keep skin youthful if one follows up with a light moisturizer.

5,False,"08 28, 2016",A2GJX2KCUSR0EI,B002RZZXYE,,Sneaky Burrito,"i got this in a beauty subscription box.  i've had it for so long i forget which box.  i needed a new exfoliator so i grabbed this from my stash.

here are the ingredients, since listing them provides a good introduction to the product:

water, lactic acid, polyethylene, soybean oil, cetearyl alcohol, pectin, papaya fruit, lactobacillus pumpkin ferment extract, ceteareth-20, cetyl alcohol, glyceryl stearate, dehydroxanthan gum, peg-100 stearate, salicylic acid, sd alcohol 40-b, bergamot fruit oil, sorbic acid, cinnamomum cassia leaf oil, honey, acetic acid, lavender oil, potassium sorbate, tocopheryl acetate, retinyl palmitate, bromelain, papain, aloe barbadensis leaf juice, phenoxyethanol, geranium maculatum oil, rosewood wood oil, pogostemon cablin oil, orange oil, linalool, limonene, cinnamal, beta-carotene (ci 75130), chlorophyllin-copper complex (ci 75810).

this is basically a chemical and physical exfoliator in one.  it has lactic acid, papaya fruit, pumpkin extract, bromelain (digestive enzyme from pineapple), and papain (digestive enzyme from papaya).  i have seen all of these in peels before.  these ingredients are why you leave this on the face for one or two minutes after scrubbing with this product -- to give the ""peel"" portion time to do its work.

it also has some kind of grit in it.  i'm not sure what the grit is, but it works as a physical exfoliator.

this has a couple of other things that will especially help oily or acne-prone skin: salicylic acid, honey (has antibacterial properties), and retinyl palmitate (vitamin a).  because of all the peeling ingredients and such, you will really want to use a good spf product while you are using this to avoid sun damage.

this may make your skin more sensitive than usual.  i am a longtime exfoliator on a daily or every other day basis, so while i do get some tingling when i use this (usually every other day since this is a bit stronger than the sorts of things i normally use), it doesn't last -- once i wash the product off, the sensation goes away.  if you have sensitive skin, you will want to be super careful.  maybe do a patch test first.  i think the tingling might be from the cinnamon; i have definitely had reactions to cinnamon oil in the past that turned my skin red, although it seems to be at a low enough level here that it is not doing that.

this is a green color, i'm guessing from the chlorophyll/copper complex.  it has the texture of a clay mask, maybe a bit thinner (easier to spread around on the face and rub in), and i can't quite place the smell, although this does have a lot of plant oils and extracts and i guess the scent is just a combination of those.  maybe something citrusy but there are also some floral notes in there.

i personally don't find this drying.  i think the concentration of the grit/solids/beads is just about right as i can actually feel them moving over my face (some exfoliators don't have enough exfoliating particles to be worth it, but this is not one of those).  it washes off cleanly and has not caused any irritation to my skin.  i do think i am getting good results -- existing breakouts are clearing up faster than usual (this is really the only change in my routine) and i'm not getting new ones, even though i am using facial oils.  (i can only use facial oils if i am also using a good exfoliator.)

i do use kind of a lot of this at once.  i could probably get by with less and actually need to learn to get by with less because this is a pretty expensive product.  but, it works and i am going to dig through my stash (which is huge) to see if i can find more, because i am really liking the results.","works very well, maybe not the best for sensitive skin",1472342400,,,0

at night, follow the same steps but replace the vitamin c serum with an exfoliant:  either the exfoliating serum or vitamin a serum.  if just using the creams, wait a couple minutes after washing your face when skin is fully dry to apply. the facial spf should be used as the final and last step of your morning routine.""",be careful if you have sensitive skin!,1485043200,6,,1

after looking at all the models, we choose this one. it holds a lot of water. it has storage in the lid for all the attachments, and it seemed easy to use.

i looked at the ones that were battery powered but i didn't think they would hold enough water and i couldn't see him refilling it to finish. this model has a big range of pressure that changes quickly with the turn of a dial. it does have to be plugged in and the handle is connected by a water tube. this does limit the distance from the unit to the mouth but it is more than enough if you are standing at a vanity.

there is a huge variety of tips but i don't think we will be using more than two or three. i actually wish that there were two or three of the basic tips for multiple family members instead of some of the other fancy tips.

the tips pop on and off easily and there is a 'pause' button on the handle that allow you to shut the water spray off quickly. this way, you can turn it on, position it in your mouth and then start the water spray.

it is easy to use. you just fill the basin with water, pick your setting with the dial, and turn it on. it is a little messy - water run off - but it is worth it! i use it on the highest setting with no discomfort or pain at all. the different heads are all very useful and store right in the lid of the basin. it flips open and there is a compartmnt to keep them all. the coiled cord stays neatly in place in the holster when not in use.

i had never used a waterpik before, and it was some revelation! i'm still amazed that there are some waterpik oldtimers who say this machine isn't strong enough...uh, for what? peeling paint off a brick wall? this thing absolutely knocked my socks off when it came to the pressure.

i started out at 2 and worked my way up to 7 - it still stings like mad, but i'm getting used to it by now. i put listerine in the tank to increase the anti-bacteria result.

regarding the leaking people talk about - the only time the tank leaks, i notice, is if i put my fingers on the seal when i'm refilling it. if i'm careful to keep my fingers away from that seal, the tank is water tight.

so when i returned for my check-up, the dentist was amazed. he wasn't sure what i had done, but he said my gums looked pink and healthy! he had said initially i'd have to get my teeth cleaned every three months because i must be one of those people who gets a tartar build up quicker than other people...well, i had worked religiously on scaling back the plaque. (i had also bought a dental mirror so i could check the back of my front teeth for telltale plaque residue.)

hmmm, no comment about that plaque...was it because there wasn't any? my dentist asked me if i had been eating because there was so little build up (i had to tear that out of him because i knew he didn't want to give me credit for working that hard on my dental hygiene!)

now that my son has some orthodontia, the dentist suggested using a waterpik.

this thing is unbelievable. the spray comes out so fast and the spray is so wide, that it makes a huge mess. even i, a coordinated adult, have a hard time using this without spraying down the bathroom walls, mirror, and countertop. this is a mess. i am worried the wallpaper will be ruined and will begin peeling off.

tip: put the device in the mouth, then turn it on. try to use it with your mouth closed or nearly closed and shut it off before you remove it from your mouth.

to get the most out of the unit you have to read the manual. it clearly states that you should not leave water in the reservoir (why you would want to anyway is beyond me - why would anyone want to use stale water?). if you don't leave water in it, it won't leak out on your counter. pretty simple equation there.

i agree with several others that the tongue cleaning attachments are basically useless. they don't fit into the holder anyway, so just toss them out. sure, try it, but i'll bet you'll find it to be basically useless compared with a true tongue cleaner (i.e., a scraper type device).

the water reservoir could be a bit bigger - an additional 20% bigger would be nice. but, it's very easy to fill even when the unit is running (keep a glass of water handy and just pour it in when the water level is at the half-way point). simple and easy, and the smaller reservoir does have the benefit of keeping the unit size nice and compact.

sound level is very low compared with past waterpik units. no, it's not silent, but it is no more noise than you would get with any other electric appliance in the bathroom such as an electric toothbrush or a shaver.  in fact, it is less noise than my shaver.

the auto-retractable hose is a very nice touch and keeps everything neat. again, a couple inches longer would be nice, but there's the compact size trade-off again.

in actual performance - wow!  you will never believe that your teeth could get this clean! wonderful feeling. there is a wide range of power adjustments ranging from very gentle to ouch! i've found setting the dial to the 5/6 range gives a good cleaning without any discomfort.

the toothbrush has 5 settings, and it lists them in the description.  i prefer the sensitive setting, as i recently had gum surgery and am now very aware of how hard i am brushing, which leads me into that nice feature.  this toothbrush will slow and the red light will come on if you are brushing too hard.  i like that, because it reminds me to use lighter pressure.  it comes with a separate display that keeps track of how long you are brushing, and also has a clock.  the brush pauses when it is time to switch sides.  i like the carrying case, as you can place the unit and the separate brushes in it.

i think it is a bit much with the display, personally.  the separate display portion is kind of a hassle.  i also wish it had a setting memory.  every time you restart the toothbrush, it starts over at the first setting, so i have to press the arrow down to get to the sensitive setting.  it takes about 7 seconds, so you have wasted that time with the brush out of your mouth, trying to find the correct setting you like.

i like it, it works well, there are just a few things i would prefer be different.  i prefer a little more of a simplistic toothbrush.",nice toothbrush with several great features,1385251200,,,0
5,False,"12 4, 2013",A1UQBFCERIP7VJ,B00CZH3K1C,,Margaret P.,"the crest + oral-professional gingivitis kit has an electric toothbrush plus timer and case, toothpaste, floss, and mouthwash in a disposable tote bag. there is a selection of four brush heads included, and i like the spinning head the best.  i have been using an oral-b 1000 model for a few weeks so can compare it to this high-end 5000 model.

the charging base is nice, with no wall wart or metal contacts. at least when new, the battery will last for more than week of twice- or thrice-daily brushings. there are several brushing modes, including one for sensitive teeth and a mode with longer brushing times.  the sensitive mode is noticeably gentler.

this model will alert when a 30 or 45 second brushing time per quadrant has finished, by pulsing and with the little radio timer.  i don't really like the timer feature but it would be very helpful to teach a child how to brush; the visual reinforcement is effective.

the brush tips change easily but don't come off under use and they have colored rings to identify brush heads for multiple users. the handle is just the right size and has soft-touch plastic so it is comfortable and easy to grip. it really is waterproof because i have been using it in the shower with no problems. i would hesitate to actually immerse the bottom of the handle, though.

it is necessary to use a soft touch with these brushes; it is not pressure but the movement of the bristles that disturbs the plaque. be especially careful if you have gum recession or crowns.  fortunately, this model warns about using too much pressure.  i find this helpful.

there is an accessory that fits over the charging base to hold extra toothbrush heads which some may find useful as well as a carrying case.  i probably wouldn't bother with the weight and bulk when traveling and will continue to carry a manual toothbrush.

no complaints at all with this toothbrush except that the handle shows water and toothpaste residue and the heads are rather costly compared to a manual toothbrush. i do think it's worth the expense, though, for the ease in brushing, although the less-expensive models have the same basic features. an electric toothbrush would be especially helpful for anyone with arthritis in the hands.",complete kit with 5000 model toothbrush,1386115200,,,0
5,False,"12 2, 2013",A1QBOC76MIOJYP,B00CZH3K1C,,MyPenName,"overall, this is an amazing value and an awesome kit. the toothbrush is just wonderful and comes with plenty of heads for different cleaning/issues.. the mouthwash is a smaller sized bottle, but plenty to see if you like it and if it works well for you. toothpaste and floss are full sized. this is a mouth transformation kit. if you have gum issues, or just want to take better care of your gums, this is the kit for you.

previously i was using sonicare diamondclean and i was in love with it. once i tried this oral b toothbrush, i gave up on my sonicare. i am 37, i smoke cigarettes, drink a lot of energy drinks, and have braces. i need extra gum care and this toothbrush along with the mouthwash and toothpaste give me that. i would say that the toothbrush alone has made a big difference from when i was using the sonicare.

i love that i can actually feel it working on my gums. it really feels like a gum massage. the smaller part of the head that moves separately is an awesome addition. that is where i feel the extra attention and the gum care. my teeth feel so clean after brushing with this one. i like that it is a more vigorous cleaning than with the sonicare. it actually took me a long time to get used to the gentle cleaning that sonicare toothbrushes give. i had been using sonicare for about 10 years, so eventually i got used to it, although i never really did feel like they were really scrubbing as much as i liked. my teeth felt clean, but there was just something missing. this oral b fills in the gap and gives me everything i am looking for, and then some. i just feel like my whole mouth is clean and fresh after using the oral b.

the mouthwash is great for gums. i put some in my waterpik (half mouthwash/half water) and i can tell a difference in the health and appearance of my gums. i do not get sore spots anymore and the sensitive areas are gone. because of my braces, i tend to get gaps between my teeth down at the gumline. debris get in there from eating and it can be painful and stay sore for a while. this mouthwash in the waterpik really helps with all of the irritation.

the toothpaste is pretty good, although i think i will stick to my regular whitening toothpaste. i like a bit more bold mint flavor and i do need the whitening benefits due to cigarette smoking. otherwise, it seems like a good toothpaste. it is a smoother mint flavor and seems to have almost a soothing effect on sore areas of the gum and mouth, so that is a plus when needed.

mainly, i am just super impressed with the toothbrush. i had also tried the oral b 7000 (black) but i much prefer this 5000 version. the 7000 was very impressive and the first oral b to really make me switch from sonicare, but just too loud. the 5000 here in this bundle just provides a better experience overall, without all of the noise. i thought the 7000 would end up being better, but it is not. it is sleek looking in black, but i just prefer the 5000 - i mean i really love it. the attention to the gums and the way it cleans so thoroughly and literally reaches every surface of the tooth, (even all around my braces!!!) is just amazing.

if you are going to invest in a good toothbrush, this is the one to buy. if you need the extra gum care and attention this is the kit to buy. you can buy the toothbrush separate if you do not want all of the extra products, but for the price, you might as well get the bundle and try out the mouthwash, toothpaste and floss and see how you like them.

i do not intend to go back to sonicare after having used this oral b. i never thought i would say that.",amazing cleaning and gum care,1385942400,,,0

i gave it a few minutes and did other things to get ready, then applied the balm over it.  the balm has a similar applicator to the lip stain part.  the balm (or you might call it a gloss) is clear.  it did pick up some of the color of the stain on the applicator when i used it, but no big deal since i'm only going to ever use the balm *with* the stain.  anyway, although the stain itself was rather drying, using the second step made this product completely comfortable to wear.  i did have to reapply the balm a few times throughout the day.

i did not get much color transfer to mugs and i did not lose much color over the course of the day.  i found the appearance of the product quite acceptable at the end of the day.  it was actually a bit difficult to get off; i used a dual phase liquid makeup remover on a cotton pad and i kind of had to scrub.  you may want to finish up with a lip scrub to ensure complete removal.  anyway, this stuff has staying power.

this is a retinol serum.  i use it on my clean skin before i put moisturizer on in the morning and at night.  .  i think that it multiplies the effect of a moisturizer by making it easier to absorb.  after six weeks of using this, my skin has a better texture and feels softer.  i don't see the finer lines on my skin.

with this bar from pre de provence i do get rich, smoothing and soothing moisturizing.  it was opportune that i had recently purchased two bars of soap from plantlife, patchouli and sandalwood.  oh, my!  those fragrances are potent and wonderful!  way more so than those from pre de provence.  having the two patchouli bars at the same time allowed me to see the moisturizing qualities of both soaps.  the plantlife dried my skin.  this pre de provence always left my skin soft and supple.  it was a big difference; so easy to see when i had the two together.

so, when it comes to the patchouli and the sandalwood soaps, which one you would like better depends on what you are looking for in a soap:  true potent fragrance or moisturizing luxury.  for me it boils down to my skin's needs in the cooler, drier months, and that means i go with the pre de provence.

so, depends on what you are looking for in your soap.  if you want the intense fragrance, choose plantlife, and give up soft and smooth skin.  i found both to give great lather, but only the pre de provence gave moisture.

to me, the scent the patchouli reminds me of ""dead heads,"" or followers of the band grateful dead.  they made patchouli oil main stream.  but patchouli is also good to fight itchy skin, and smells wonderful. it has an unmistakable musky floral aroma.

this soap is also shea butter enriched, which means luxurious softness.  nothing i've found blends into my skin like shea butter, and i have been religiously using pre de provence lotions with shea butter for a while now.  their products are high quality and make me feel pampered.  the scents are delicious - i am feeding my soul with these wonderful fragrances.

while women will love this patchouli shea butter enriched soap, it will also be great for a man.  patchouli is quite masculine.

this bar of soap is great for putting in your bathtub.  or keep a bar at the sink to lather up and smell good between showers.  it makes a great gift - an addition to a gift basket for men or women.  heaven probably smells a little like patchouli and the scent is captured in this bar of soap.  it's fantastic.","the smell of musk, peace, and love",1505952000,,,0

Poza,"this is an average-sized bar of scented french-milled, french-made soap designed to over a more luxurious experience than consumer-grade soaps. i will be comparing this both in use and in price to average body bars, but my rating takes into the account that this is a premium product which offers certain benefits that you cannot get from products like basic ivory soap or kirkland's body bar. this gets extra points for those added qualities.

i will note the price differences first. this is a 150-gram bar for a little under $5 whereas a 130-gram bar of kirkland signature will cost you an average of 66 cents. both bars will get you equally clean, but that is really the only point where the products overlap. besides the truly lovely rose scent of this bar (it smells like a real rose  mild and not too overbearing, but present), it has a much better feel. the lather is creamier and feels silkier on the skin. one point about it that i was really happy about was that it wasn't so perfumey that i walked out of the shower smelling as if i'd applied a scent to my skin. this was more of an enjoyable transient experience in which i enjoyed the scent while i was using it, but didn't subject others to it once i was out of the bath. in my case, my husband is super sensitive to perfume-like smells so this worked for me. if you're looking for something longer lasting, this may not be what you're after.

in terms of how it leaves my skin, this is absolutely better for not drying my skin out. i'm guessing that this is the shea butter replenishing to some extent what oils the soap is stripping off when you use the soap. i wouldn't say that you don't need an added moisturizer after using it (at least i still needed moisturizer), but it's definitely gentler than other bars that i've used.

the bar is very hard or solid in a way that consumer-grade bars are not. this is because of the quad-milling that is advertised on the product page. i had not heard about this process before trying this soap, but it reduces the water content of the bars and makes them last longer. i will note that my average bar of soap will tend to melt in the shower and there are little stalactites of soap residue on my soap dish on my shower caddy where the soap has dissolved and the residue has drained off and hardened (which represents a loss of soap/value). this soap doesn't do that. it dries harder and firmer and doesn't melt away at the edges. that means that it lasts a lot longer. i can't do a scientific test or anything, but my best guess is that i got 3x the mileage out of this bar than the kirkland bars that i usually use (and possibly 4x the use compared to ivory, which i find melts away much more rapidly than any other soap). this is still a more expensive soap on average than consumer-grade brands, but it isn't quite as expensive as it seems when you factor in longevity and the quality of experience is rather markedly better in terms of the feel and the scent.","lasts longer than mass-mproduced consumer soaps, natural scent",1504828800,,,0

this is a nice bar of soap. it has a hard consistency, not a soft bar so it seems to last longer. the soap provides a lot of suds which makes you feel like you are getting clean. it is a large size too which my husband really loves.

i had never smelled starflower before. the scent of the soap is a floral but not in a heavy or sweet type scent, it smells nothing like roses or magnolias but is just clean floral scent. im not a big fan of florals and this one is ok, my husband doesnt care for anything girly scented and he doesnt mind this one either.","large bar, floral but nice and clean smelling",1503964800,,,0

my skin visually appears more moisturized when i use this  soap (compared to the brand that was previously in my shower). i still required lotion but could have skipped it without feeling dry and itchy.

 linden smells like an ultra-mild lily-of-the-valley fragrance.  peony smells... like a peony (assumption as i've never sniffed one before). i don't like the way that angel's trumpet smells.  it doesn't impact my rating... this just isn't the fragrance for me. i don't dislike it enough to let it go to waste so this isn't a deal breaker.

when using this soap the fragrance is stronger in the air than on my skin. it creates a relaxing experience without leaving the skin heavily perfumed.

the color of the soap is a bright green-yellow. more yellow. peony is a soft blush/shell pink. angel trumpet is a yellow-beige that my kids describe as r sandy-yellow. there is a marbled like consistency to this barbiturates am overall smooth feel.  the bars have a 12/2019 expiration date on them.a

the soap does not get water-logged and squishy and that is a great indicator that the bar will last more than a week.

this bar though is mild in comparison and very pleasant.  about on par with the normal pink or green dove bar soap that we sometimes purchase.  (i think the white has the least smell.  white dove is our household standard.)

Poza,"i tend to be the sort of person who just buys the cheapest soap with the lightest scent available rather than try to find something with particular qualities. however, after using this soap, i may have to rethink that habit. this soap really does seem to leave skin feeling both clean (with no film left after rinsing) and quite soft. the claims on the back about containing 1/4 moisturizing cream appear to be quite true. compared to the sometimes tight, post shower feel that i get with my usual choice of soap (generally the plain kirkland brand at costco), this is clearly a superior bar of soap.

the only drawback to this soap is the scent, which is the usual strong smell for men's hair and body products. if it were a little less intense, it'd be okay, but it is so strong that the paper box the soap comes in reeks of it. if you're okay with the strong smell and you want something which leaves you very clean but still with soft skin, this is a pretty good choice which is several cuts above the cheap stuff.","perfect, except for the strong scent",1365120000,,,0

the first thing i did when i got it home was smell it and was not impressed with the odor, in fact i thought it was extremely unpleasent. i figured i'll use it to shave, than wash it off and that will be the end of it. but noooo i shaved than washed it off 1 time, 2 times than a third time and the smell did not disappear from my face or hands. plus the odor lingered for hours. i don't know if it is just me but i think the smell is just awful and i would not buy it again just for that reason. i would check out the other brands on the market.

as for the actual purpose of this lotion, i was impressed it worked exceptionally well. the razor glided over my face without any kind of drag and evidently did what it was supposed to since i got an exceptionally close comfortable shave.

so 5 stars for the shave and 1 star for the odor. i have plenty of after shave lotions that i really like and resent the fact that i am forced to use there odor if i want a good shave. odorless for this product would be a definite plus. my 2 cats won't eat any treats i give them if i have this odor on my hands, at least i have 2 paw's up on my assessment of the odor. ha!",yes it works quite well ~ but unpleasent odor ~,1302480000,12,,1

this is a generous amount of dried (loose) lavender blossoms designed to act in the same fashion as potpourri. the most important aspect to this product is the scent which i found to be delicate and natural. lavender in general can be fairly overbearing, and you can smell this through the packet as it is relatively potent. however, it is not cloying or suffocating in its potency. i'm guessing this is because it's not as concentrated as a perfume or extract.

when you have the bag open and are exposed to all of it at once, it seems really strong, but as something you place in a location in lesser quantities, it doesn't tend to be so overbearing. i think that it strikes a good balance between being potent enough to have an effect and not being so potent as to make you queasy from a strong scent. i have had a lavender-scented face mask (the sort filled with beans that you heat or cool and apply to your face) for some time and found that putting that mask in a plastic zipper bag with a sachet made from these dried blossoms helped revived the fading scent quite well without have to risk staining the mask or making it smell too strong from using oils or perfume.

if there is any weak point to this, it is the presentation which can be a bit messy. i had to be very careful when opening the package not to spill the small, dried bits. it would have been better if it had come in a resealable package or a jar of some sort given how tiny they are. i decanted mine into a jar both to keep the scent contained in the long run and to more easily manage them. still, since this point is intrinsic to the type of product this is (tiny dried blossoms), i'm not dinging it for that, but just noting it.",good natural scent,1505520000,,,0

i love essie nail polish, i have a nice size collection of the regular polish. i also love gel nail polish - i have my own tools (led light).

standard nail polish never lasts more than 24 hours on my fingernail no matter what i do. therefore i was excited to try the 2 step polish that requires no led light but resembles gel polish and a hopes for a 14 day wear.

i did two test runs:

test 1:
did no nail prep -i just followed directions, two coats of color, one coat of top.  dries quickly, leaves great gloss

day 1: looks great
day 2: very small chipping to start on dominate hand
day 3: removed: chipping on 85% of nails

test 2:
i removed all the polish and prep my nails this time just as i would with doing real gels. (push back cuticle, buff nail to remove shine, cleans, add dehydrator, two coats color, one coat of top.

day 1-2: looks great, the shine lasted
day 3: chipping starting on dominate hand
day 4: removed

granted, i did get a longer wear out of this polish than i have my typical essie nail polish (or any brand for that matter).  i just have a naturally oil nail bed, but doing some of the prep-work i was able to get one more extra day of the polish.  so this is defiantly an improvement!

all essie's are great.  i wear them almost exclusively as they are almost the only thing that wears above a day on my crazy nails.  i can typically get about a week with any essie (and i can go beyond that with their gel couture).  i do reapply top coat every 2nd or third day.

the gel couture polishes are a thicker more gelly like formula than the ""regular"" essies.  they i also have a wider brush, but it's so nicely tapered that it's easy to work with.  i would recommend the ""regular"" essies if you want to do nail art, but for regular one-color wear, either formula is nice.  the gel couture line does wear a little longer, but i'm typically ready to change colors before i reach their maximum wear time.

one of my favorite aspects of essie is that its very forgiving if you happen to be prone to messing up your nails.  they dry quickly once the top coat is on (the color is a little more vulnerable to marring before the  top coat is applied), and as they dry they self-level to give you a smooth glassy surface even if your technique (like mine) is imperfect.

the gel couture line really requires the matching top coat to get its wear time, but i use that top coat over other essies quite often as well.

now, i know you might be tempted to use a heavier layer of color and then a heavier layer of color for a super rich look. avoid this. by following the directions and using two regular coats, you are going to get a less streaky and more uniform color. trust me, if you go a little heavy, it's going to take longer to dry and look clumpy. so, by going the easy route, the product is going to look its best. so, win-win!

5,False,"08 14, 2017",A2CZ98V784SRJ0,B01E7UKR38,{'Color:': ' V.I.Please'},L. Perry,"i **love** my essies.  they are by far my favorite nail polish brand (and one of only two brands i will buy--only others are impossible on my nails).  even though i have less-than-stellar technique and i am admittedly horribly hard on my nails, with essie i can keep my nails looking professionally manicured without chips, redos, or drama. i am loyal to this brand for a reason!

wear time:  i'm fairly new to the gel couture line, though i've worn the classic essie polishes for much longer.  i wondered how these would compare to my regular essie routing (which is, grow stronger base coat, 2 coats of color, followed by good to go top coat), and i was astounded to find they compare very, very favorably.  i swear by essie base coat, but was impressed that gel couture performed equally well with and without it.  (i do still like using it for a treatment layer and to prevent nail discoloration overtime; with gel couture i noticed no difference in wear time with or without base coat, though base coat  is a game changer with the classic essies).  with my classic essie colors, i tend to get about a week of wear, but do reapply top coat intermittently during the week (my goal is always every other day, but i usually forget pretty often).  in testing these out, i resisted reapplying top coat at all, so that i could get a sense of how they wore on one application.  i'm quite impressed.  i got 11 days of wear, with a small few chips coming of the 11th or 12th day (depending on the shade).  i'm more than satisfied with that, given that i'm ridiculously hard on my nails and don't own a dishwasher.  also, aside from essie, i've found (at any price point) that there's only one other brand that doesn't chip within 24 hours (i can usually get 4 or 5 days with revlon, so it's my second choice).  i went from a week with ""regular"" essie to almost two weeks with these.  these last well past the point where i want to change my polish colors.

color application:  i've tried 7 of these gala bolds (as well as some from the original release and all but two of the ballet nudes), and i would say that with the exception of one shade, all of these polishes are dreamy to work with.  these are slightly thicker, more jelly like consistency than the classic essies.  they are smooth and self leveling, apply like butter and look as smooth as satin.  the drip-free brush has a fabulous contour, so even working on my small nails, the wider brush was not an issue.  most shades were opaque in one coat (but i'm a two coat girl, so i went for two anyway).  as essie herself says, they ""go on like silk and wear like iron.""  the one color with a less stellar experience was ""wearing hue"" and if you sort amazon reviews by color (yup, that's possible) you'll notice that most of the few negative reviews relate to that shade.  it's not an impossible shade, and milky opaque pastel colors are the more ""struggle-some"" colors in any range.  however, i did need a third coat to get to opaque and needed be more careful about not overflowing the nail bed. it still self leveled and wore beautifully.  i'd give this one shade 4 stars, but the others deserve more than 5.

(and anytime you are working with essie, be patient with your perceived mistakes; give them a moment, they will self level and look as smooth as a calm sea even if you thought your application wasn't perfect.  they may be magic.)

top coat:  i've taken to using this top coat with regular essies instead of my good to go top coat.  there's magic in this bottle. instead of getting 6-7 days with classic essies, i can get more (though, i rarely want to, as i like to change my nail colors.)  with this top coat on gel couture, i am seeing 11 days!  also, though i reapplied the good to go throughout the week, i don't feel the need to reapply with this one.  the good to go might stay a little (tiny bit) shinier through the week, but that's a hard call.  though both wear well, this is my favorite.  both dry super fast.  like, ridiculously fast.  (i am currently testing the gel setter one, so i can't compare it yet.)  you do need to use this top coat with the gel couture polishes (or they won't last), however it's nice that it will work with traditional essies as well.

i called essie about this platinum gel couture top coat, since i wasn't sure if it was supposed to be an improvement on the gel couture top coat (which is what it was called in the initial release of this line).  essie has fabulous customer service, and they were able to confirm that it was a rebranding, and gel couture top coat and platinum gel couture top coat are the same thing, just slightly rebranded.

i can never recommend essie enough.  they changed my nail game.  when i was almost ready to give up because fixing my nails took soooo long to do and to dry and i was getting so frustrated with fixing my mistakes, i discovered essie.  they are magic, i tell you.  they dry to a pro finish in spite of weak skills, and before i have a chance to screw them up.  and they stay on my impossible nails.  there's nothing remotely as good.  love these!!!!",eleven days of wear (from someone who is sooooo hard on her nails!),1502668800,,,0

this polish was still going strong with only a hint of wear on the tip of one nail after 7 days. the top coat was still extremely shiny. my nails show growth at the base of the nail, so i usually change polish after 7 days. but if not for that, i probably could have gotten another couple days out of this polish. great product!",lovely shade for winter or summer - viplease,1501286400,,,0

Graham,"this review is for essie gel couture nail polish set with the 144-inside scoop and platinum grade finish top coat.  ""inside scoop"" is a tea rose pink with a slight blue undertone. the color goes on streak free and doesn't require a basecoat.  i am able to get consistent, non-streak opaque color with one application - second application not needed but does seem to prolong the wear.  the top coat provides protection and shine.  it creates a hard shell which prevents chipping and has a high gloss.

i find this easy to remove and it lasts about 6 days with 2 color coats and one top coat.  i let it dry 3-5 minutes between each color coat and 10 minutes after the top coat.  the results look like what you'd get from a nail salon and lasts the whole week.  the shape of the brush allows for precise application.

overall, i would recommend this product to a friend.","long lasting, great color",1501200000,,,0

i did two test runs:

did no nail prep. just followed directions, two coats of color, one coat of top.

dries quickly, leaves great gloss

day 1: looks great
day 2: very small chipping to start on dominate hand.
day 3: chipping on 85% of nails

i remove all polish and prep my nails this time just as i would with doing real gel nails. (push back cuitical, buf nail to remove shine, cleans, add dehydrator, two coats color, one coat of top.

day 1-2: looks great
day 3: chipping starting on dominate hand
day 4: removed

because i can get a much longer wear than my regular polish i say this is a win. a girl (or guy) that tylically gets a fairly long wear with regular polish may get a 5-7 day wear but 14 days may be a streach!

first of all, i hate it when you get a cream polish and it takes three or four coats in order to get it to look opaque. there was so much pigmentation in this nail polish that i could have gotten by with just one coat, although i put on two. the photograph shows the two coats on my hand.
after doing one hand, the polish started to thicken up a little on my second hand. i've noticed that this often happens with quick dry formulas. no problem, i just wait a minute and then reshake the bottle.
if you don't do that, it can come out thick, which makes it a little streaky or textured. even if that's the case, all of those imperfections disappear when you apply this magical top coat. no, i'm not exaggerating. it really is magic.
it evens the color and gives you a perfect shine that lasts for days and days.

and here is the part that i want to shout out... if all of the above weren't enough to make you really love this stuff, hold on because there's more.
i have long complained that i don't like the essie nail polish brushes. they're great if you have small and short nails, in my opinion, but not for me.
the brush has a perfect curve that matches the base of your nail, and it's wider so that with three strokes, middle side, and side, you are done. the brush holds just the right amount of polish.
this review is for the viplease color. i think of it as a hibiscus or raspberry shade.
it looks great when you're wearing blue, pink, and even certain shades of burgundy. it's absolutely stunning with tropical prints that include flowers and greenery.
getting the kit is a great way to try the top coat.

while essie states 'up to 14 days', one has to assess what effects those 14 days.

first off, this is an extremely pale opaque white with a hint of pink.

application will require 3 even light coats of this shade, followed by its top coat.  let dry thoroughly between.  not quite the gel shine tho.

this color is pale, which could account for results.

he brushes with enthusiasm now, and i've noticed his teeth looking much cleaner than with just a brush alone.  for me, it's a helpful reminder to brush longer than i was used to.  the whole set is convenient, with a countertop charger and no batteries being required.  and having a clock in the bathroom was new to me, and very convenient.

however, two things keep me from giving it five stars.  one, the price point.  i wouldn't pay more than $50 for this set.  in all actuality, it doesn't seem worth the extremely high price point.  i mean, a crest tote bag?  what am i going to do with that?  i don't think the set warrants the price.

the other minor point about this is you have to brush with your mouth tightly closed or you get watery toothpaste sprayed all over the mirror and counter.  not to mention your face!  my son has to brush before he dresses or his school shirts get ruined.  so, it's a minor thing to get used to, but sort of annoying.

in all, a great set that would be better if it were more affordable.",excellent set but a steep price!,1386633600,,,0

""smooth"" fits the flavor/strength perfectly. it is not harsh at all, but still effective.

this mouthwash claims to help with inflammation and soreness of the gums. i'd say this claim is true. i wear braces and do get inflamed/sore gums from time to time. crest pro-health for life has helped with that. it actually soothes the gums. the inflammation goes away much quicker.

i used this in my waterpik with great results as well. normally, i fill it up half way with warm water and the rest of the way with listerine. my orthodontist recommended this on account of the gaps i get from my braces, to clean good and disinfect the loose gum area and to help the irritation/inflammation. i feel like this pro-health does a better job in that area - it feels like it is soothing the sore spots and like i said, the inflammation, soreness and redness goes away much faster.

i did ask my orthodontist about using this mouthwash, if it would be beneficial to me in regards to the gum issues, since this product is meant for people over 50 years of age - i am only 36. he said it definitely could not hurt to try and would probably work well since it is made for gum issues. he told me to let him know how it goes. when i told him i believed it worked better and helped more, he told me to continue to use it. when he looked in my mouth in order to determine the adjustments for my braces during that visit, he mentioned to me that 2 particular areas look better than usual. the gum line at two specific teeth was always more red than any other area, even though it was never actually painful or swollen. since i started using the pro-health, that redness has gone away.

to me, this product is very beneficial, while being gentle. there is no harsh alchohol taste, no nasty after taste. it is just simply a smooth mint flavor, just like the bottle says, that makes your mouth taste and feel fresh. in my case, it definitely did help with gum problems and for that reason i will continue to use it regularly.",smooth!,1368576000,2,,0
